           <p class="gtr-para">When thinking of Nissan GTR, the current R35 comes to mind. <br> But what made this model so famous was the Nissan Skyline GTR (R32), <br> dubbed "Godzilla" by the Australian press due to its Japanese origins. <br>

            The Nissan Skyline is a cult favourite since it has appeared <br> in many video games and films. The R32, R33, and R34 are the rarest models <br> right now and can't be easily found on used-car websites.</p>
